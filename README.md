# Cartoonification
Downscale the image and then apply bilateral filter to get a cartoon flavour. Then again we upscale the 
image. 
Bilateral Filter: This filter is the key element in the colour image processing chain, as it homogenizes 
colour regions while preserving edges, even over multiple iterations. 
Getting a blurred version of the original image. For this, we first convert the image to gray â€“ scale and 
then we apply the media blur filter. 
Next step is to identify the edges in the image using  Edge Detection. 
Edge Detection- Process of identifying edges in an image to be used as a fundamental asset in image 
analysis and locating areas with strong intensity contrasts.
